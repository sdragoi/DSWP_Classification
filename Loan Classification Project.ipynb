    "Our team is made up of data scentists for the consumer loan division of HansenBank. The objective of this project is to build a predictive logistic regression model that is useful for classifying loans as \"not default\" or \"default\". We also hope to accomplish four subtasks in support of this objective:\n",
    "* To analyze the data provided\n",
    "* To find which factors have a good ability to predict loan default\n",
    "* To build a predictive model that can predict which loans are likely to go into default\n",
    "* To suggest profitable policies for determining loan approval criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "We wish to predict whether loan applications are likely to result in performing or nonperforming loans in order to maximize profitability. Approving performing loans will allow HansenBank to make a profit, since the customer will make payments on time and pay an interest rate that is higher than the rate the bank itself has to pay to acquire the money for the loan. Avoiding nonperforming loans will prevent the bank from losing money. Customers who don't make payments on time or default on the loan altogether will force the bank to use time and money to pressure the customer and to recover collateral.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the null hypothesis of \"situation normal/performing loan\" in the context of this project, a Type I error occurs if the bank incorrectly rejects the null hypothesis even though the loan would have become performing. A Type II error occurs if the bank fails to reject the null hypothesis and approves the loan even though the loan will ultimately become nonperforming. We conclude that though Type I and Type II error are similar in the net loss they may incur, Type II errors are marginally worse. Type I errors would result in a loss of money due to the cost of defending against a lawsuit, which certainly would not occur in all cases of such errors. We do not consider failure to earn money that could have hypothetically been earned in the absence of such an error as a loss. Type II errors, however, always carry with them the cost of losing the loan and recovering collateral. Both errors may also result in a loss of a customer, whether it's due to the customer not wanting to do business with the bank that rejected their loan or wanting to avoid the bank that they failed to fulfill loan payments to.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on our decision that both types of errors are equally severe, we will most likely emphasize accuracy and recall as performance metrics, but will also consider the F1 statistic. Accuracy will measure the overall correctness of the model, recall will measure the model's performance on predicting the positive class, and F1 will recognize the tradeoff between recall and precision, or of avoiding Type II or Type I errors."
